# How Many Days Since Michigan Beat Ohio State?

This is a proudly Buckeye-forward Astro site that keeps track of the number of days since Michigan last beat Ohio State. It celebrates scarlet and gray supremacy with rotating celebratory imagery, Columbus time updates, and the same vintage styling the original site used to rub salt in Michigan's wounds.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20.x (the Astro CLI and tooling expect a modern Node runtime)
- npm 9+ (bundled with current Node releases)

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
```

Astro will install locally in `node_modules` along with the few other build-time dependencies the project needs.

## Local Development

Start an interactive dev server with hot reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The site will be served at the URL printed in the terminal (typically <http://localhost:4321>). You can edit the `src/pages/index.astro` page or the styles under `public/` and immediately see those changes reflected.

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Astro will emit the static site into `dist/`. You can preview the production build locally by running:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Project Structure

- `src/pages/index.astro` – The single page that renders the Buckeye propaganda, computes the days-since count, and randomizes the featured celebratory image.
- `public/` – Static assets carried over from the original site, including the font, CSS, and triumphant Buckeye imagery.
- `astro.config.mjs` – Minimal Astro configuration for the project.

## Buckeye Pride

We are unabashedly pro-Buckeye here. The copy, imagery, and counter all exist to remind the college football world that Ohio State runs this rivalry. If you are looking for sympathy for Michigan, you will not find it in this repository. Go Bucks!
